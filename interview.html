            <h3>Tips for Interview</h3>
            <p style="color: goldenrod;text-align: center;">Great interviews arise from careful groundwork. You can ace your next interview if you:<br></p>
            <p style="font-size: 17px;">1. Enter into a state of relaxed concentration. This is the state from which great basketball players or Olympic skaters operate. You'll need to quiet the negative self chatter in your head through meditation or visualization prior to sitting down in the meeting.You'll focus on the present moment and will be less apt to experience lapses in concentration, nervousness, self-doubt and self-condemnation. 

 

                <br><br>2. Act spontaneous, but be well prepared. Be your authentic self,professional yet real. Engage in true conversation with your interviewer, resting on the preparation you did prior to coming to the meeting. Conduct several trial runs with another person simulating the interview before it actually occurs. It's the same as anticipating the questions you'll be asked on a final exam. 
                
                 
                
                <br><br>3. Set goals for the interview. It is your job to leave the meeting feeling secure that the interviewer knows as much as he or she possibly can about your skills, abilities, experience and achievements. If you sense there are misconceptions, clear them up before leaving. If the interviewer doesn't get around to asking you important questions, pose them yourself (diplomatically) and answer them. Don't leave the meeting without getting your own questions answered so that you have a clear idea of what you would be getting yourself into. If possible, try to get further interviews, especially with other key players. 
                
                 
                
                <br><br>4. Know the question behind the question. Ultimately, every question boils down to, "Why should we hire you?" Be sure you answer that completely. If there is a question about your meeting deadlines,consider whether the interviewer is probing delicately about your personal life, careful not to ask you whether your family responsibilities will interfere with your work. Find away to address fears if you sense they are present. 
                
                 
                
                <br><br>5. Follow up with an effective "thank you" letter. Don't write this letter lightly. It is another opportunity to market yourself.Find some areas discussed in the meeting and expand upon them in your letter. Writing a letter after a meeting is a very minimum. Standing out among the other candidates will occur if you thought fully consider this follow up letter as an additional interview in which you get to do all the talking. Propose useful ideas that demonstrate your added value to the team.

            <h3>How To Dress For Your Next Job Interview</h3>
            <p><h4>Men</h4>

                    <br>Long-sleeved shirt and dark slacks. White is still the safest and the best color for shirts. The colour is also appropriate for our tropical weather. Also acceptable: pale shades such as beige, blue, and other pastels.
                    
                    <br><br>Tuck in the shirt and do not roll up the sleeves. Never wear a short-sleeved shirt to an interview or any business purpose. Wearing a short-sleeved shirt will destroy your executive image.  
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Ties</h4> (Optional): But if you do wear one, choose a conservative pattern. Solids, small polka dots, diagonal stripes, small repeating shapes, subtle plaids and paisleys are all acceptable.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Belts:</h4> Belts should match your shoes. Those with smaller buckles with squared lines look more professional.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Socks:</h4> Black socks are the best, followed by blue or gray, depending on your attire. Never wear white socks! Check your sock length, too--no skin should show when you sit down or cross your legs. Shoes. Black or burgundy leather shoes with laces on them, because tassel loafers are very casual. Other suitable colors are brown, cordovan and navy.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Hair:</h4> Keep neat, short and preferably parted on the side. And shave off all those facial hair.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Jewellery:</h4> Wear no or little jewellery. The watch and wedding ring are the only acceptable pieces of jewellery to go with the male attire. Thin gold or leather-strapped watches look professional but not digital watches. Also, avoid political or religious insignias, necklaces or bracelets. Definitely Accessories. As much as possible, use leather briefcases or folders to hold copies of your resume. Use narrow briefcases and avoid plastic folders and plastic ball pens as they are out of place.
            </p>
            <p><h4>Women</h4>

                    <br>Three-piece business suits, blouse and skirt or slacks, and cardigan twin-sets. Sleeveless shirts should be rejected. Short-sleeved blouses are okay when they are tailor-cut or have features such as a sports collar or double breast design to create a business-like look. Skirts can either be long provided it does not create a Cinderella or barn-dance look or short where it falls no shorter than two inches from the knee. Nothing too revealing, please!
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Panty-hose or stockings:</h4> A must for professional grooming, but nothing with overly fussy patterns. Bring an extra pair, just in case the ones you are wearing run.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Shoes:</h4> Closed shoes or pumps with at least 1½-inch heels suggest a more professional look. Dark colors are best.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Hair :</h4>Hair longer than shoulder length should be worn up or pulled back. Don't let it fall in front of your face and don't keep trying to fix it during the interview. Avoid large hair ornaments and trendy hairstyles.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Make-up:</h4> Be subtle; natural is the key word. Light shades of lip coloring and nail polish are recommended.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Jewellery:</h4> Be conservative. Studs of gold, silver or pearls are best. Do away with gaudy fashion jewelers, and those that clank and make noise when one moves.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Accessories:</h4>Folders and bags should blend well with the total professional look. Women should match their purse with their shoe colour.

            <h3>Interview Preparation and basic tips </h3>
            <p style="color: goldenrod;">
                People often say "you never get a second chance to make a first impression", and that's actually quite true—which is why it's so important to start on the right foot.
                
                So, knowing that, how do you make the best first impression possible?
                
                Everyone's different, and while you don't want to be too formulaic, there are definitely a few things you'll want to keep in mind that should universally help show you in a positive light while preparing for a job or employment interview.Small things make a huge difference and we have listed tips to make the first impression the best and make the interview a successful one.
                
            </p><br>
            <p style="font-size: 17px;">1. Your interview starts the moment you walk into the building; anyone you meet may be connected with the hiring manager or the hiring team.

                <br><br>2. Be nice to everyone you meet from the receptionist up to the senior-level executives;everyone's opinion counts.
                
                <br><br>3. If interviewing with several people at the same time, give everyone equal attention; you never know who the real decision maker is.
                
                <br><br>4. Answer interview questions by communicating strong stories of success; prove what makes you unique rather than just explaining what you did.
                
                <br><br>5. Try to ask questions throughout the interview; it should be a conversation not an  interrogation.
                
                <br><br>6. Asking questions during the interview helps you uncover key issues and better prepares you to answer questions throughout the interview.
                
                <br><br>7. Be sure to ask what the next steps in the interview process are so you can prepare an appropriate follow-up strategy.
                
                <br><br>8. Create a brief and visually interesting presentation about your skills and achievements to  give to the hiring manager during the interview.
                
                <br><br>9. When asked questions about mistakes you have made, be authentic, explain what you learned from the experience, and don't get defensive.
                
                <br><br>10. If asked about your weaknesses, don't spin weaknesses into strengths; it's not credible and who wants to hire someone they don't trust?
            </p><br>
            <h3>Interview body language</h3><br>
            <p style="color: goldenrod;text-align: center;font-size: 20px;">How Body Language Can Make or Break Your Interview</p>
            <p>We all know interviews are nerve racking! What do you think is more important in an interview: what you say or body language? The answer is BODY LANGUAGE! 

                <br>Many job seekers practice what they are going to say in an interview, but few think about body language. With a little more practice, a candidate can show off their confidence, professionalism, and leave a more positive impression on the interviewer, which will better their chances in landing the job!
                
                <br><h4 style="font-size: 18px;">Studies show that messages and/or meaning are communicated in the following ways:<br>
                * 55% by body language and facial expressions<br>
                * 38% by your tone of voice<br>
                * 7% by what you actually say<br><br></h4>
                <h4>Body Posture</h4><br>

                The experts agree that aiming for a neutral posture is your best bet. “Leaning back suggests boredom or lack of interest "

                <br>" Leaning forward can be just as problematic, as it can seem overly solicitous or even threatening. “Don’t crowd the interviewer by leaning in too closely or over his or her desk,” 

                <br>Standing or sitting up straight sends a message of self-assuredness—but it also makes you appear taller, which around the world is seen as a sign of smarts, confidence and credibility.
                During the interview sit up straight, relax your shoulders, and fold your hands together in your lap. Some people don't know what to do with their hands, so it is best to keep them folded. Don't fold your arms across your chest. This can indicate a defensive attitude.



 

                <br><br><h4>The posture with arms and legs crossed (POSTURE B) is called a CLOSED posture. It usually signifies a defensive or negative attitude, but beware of misinterpretation - the person may just be cold. The other posture with arms and legs uncrossed (POSTURE A) is called an OPEN posture and usually suggests a more relaxed, open attitude.</h4><br>

                 <br><h4>Physical Gestures</h4><br>

                <span>Pointing</span> is often perceived as an aggressive motion and in some cultures is considered incredibly rude. Eventoff says any fast, repeated or aggressive hand gestures should be kept to a minimum.

                <span>“Avoid chopping gestures"</span> chop gestures can psychologically cut up the space between you ad your interview in an aggressive way.

                <span>Enunciate your words and phrase precisely.</span> Also, don't speak in a monotone voice- this shows a lack of enthusiasm.

                <span>Don't fidget!</span> It can be very distracting to the interviewer if you shake your leg, play with your hair, wave your hands, click a pen, ect. Make sure to keep hand gestures to a small movement.

                Make sure to show enthusiasm in the interview: <span>smile, nod your head,</span> ect.

            </p>
            <p style="color: goldenrod;font-size: 20px;">"Before going on your next interview, make sure to practice your body language. "</p>
