            <h3>RESUME TIPS-15 Golden Tips For Good resume !</h3>
            <p>"Your resume is a marketing tool that lists a summary of your qualifications for employment. It will typically let the reader know what type of position you are seeking and will highlight your education, experience, skills and other relevant information. The best way to determine what should be included on your resume is to ask yourself what the potential employer would want to know about you to consider you for the position. The primary purpose of the resume is to get you an interview. Use the following tips to “wow” a future employer:"</p>
            <br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><h4>15 Golden Tips</h4><br>

                The thought of writing a resume intimidates almost anyone. It's difficult to know where to start or what to include. It can seem like an insurmountable task. Here are 15 tips to help you not only tackle the task, but also write a winning resume.<br><br><br>
                
                
                <h4>1.Determine your job search objective prior to writing the resume.</h4> Once you have determined your objective, you can structure the content of your resume around that objective. Think of your objective as the bull's-eye to focus your resume on hitting. If you write your resume without having a clear objective in mind, it will likely come across as unfocused to those that read it. Take the time before you start your resume to form a clear objective.<br>
                <br><h4>2.Think of your resume as a marketing tool.</h4> Think of yourself as a product, potential

                employers as your customers, and your resume as a brochure about you. Market yourself through your resume. What are your features and benefits? What makes you unique? Make sure to convey this information in your resume. <br>
                <br><h4>3.Use your resume to obtain an interview, not a job.</h4> You don't need to go into detail

                about every accomplishment. Strive to be clear and concise. The purpose of your resume is to generate enough interest in you to have an employer contact you for an interview. Use the interview to provide a more detailed explanation of your accomplishments and to land a job offer.<br>


                <br><h4>4.Use bulleted sentences.</h4> In the body of your resume, use bullets with short sentences rather than lengthy paragraphs. Resumes are read quickly. This bulleted sentence format makes it easier for someone to quickly scan your resume and still absorb it.<br>
                <br><h4>5.Use action words.</h4> Action words cause your resume to pop. To add life to your resume, use bulleted sentences that begin with action words like prepared, developed, monitored, and presented.<br>


                <br><h4>6.Use</h4> #'s, Rs. and %'s. Numbers, dollars, and percentages stand out in the body of a resume. Use them. Here are two examples: 
                * Managed a department of 10 with a budget of Rs.1,000,000. 
                * Increased sales by 25% in a 15-state territory. <br>


                <br><h4>7.Lead with your strengths.</h4> Since resumes are typically reviewed in 30 seconds, take the time to determine which bullets most strongly support your job search objective. Put those strong points first where they are more apt to be read. <br>


                <br><h4>8.Play Match Game.</h4> Review want ads for positions that interest you. Use the key words listed in these ads to match them to bullets in your resume. If you have missed any key words, add them to your resume. <br>


                <br><h4>9.Use buzzwords.</h4> If there are terms that show your competence in a particular field, use them in your resume. For marketing people, use "competitive analysis." For accounting types, use "reconciled accounts." <br>
                <br><h4>10.Accent the positive.</h4> Leave off negatives and irrelevant points. If you feel your date of graduation will subject you to age discrimination, leave the date off your resume. If you do some duties in your current job that don't support your job search objective, leave them off your resume. Focus on the duties that do support your objective. Leave off irrelevant personal information like your height and weight. <br>


                <br><h4>11.Show what you know.</h4> Rather than going into depth in one area, use your resume to highlight your breadth of knowledge. Use an interview to provide more detail.<br>


                <br><h4>12.Show who you know.</h4> If you have reported to someone important such as a vice president or department manager, say so in your resume. Having reported to someone important causes the reader to infer that you are important.<br>


                <br><h4>13.Construct your resume to read easily.</h4> Leave white space. Use a font size no smaller than 10 point. Limit the length of your resume to 1-2 pages. Remember, resumes are reviewed quickly. Help the reader to scan your resume efficiently and effectively. <br>


                <br><h4>14.Have someone else review your resume.</h4> Since you are so close to your situation, it can be difficult for you to hit all your high points and clearly convey all your accomplishments. Have someone review your job search objective, your resume, and listings of positions that interest you. Encourage them to ask questions. Their questions can help you to discover items you inadvertently left off your resume. Revise your resume to include these items. Their questions can also point to items on your resume that are confusing to the reader. Clarify your resume based on this input. <br>


                <br><h4>15.Submit your resume to potential employers.</h4> Have the courage to submit your resume. Think of it as a game where your odds of winning increase with every resume you submit. You really do increase your odds with every resume you submit. Use a three-tiered approach. Apply for some jobs that appear to be beneath you. Perhaps they will turn out to be more than they appeared to be once you interview for them. Or perhaps once you have your foot in the door you can learn of other opportunities. Apply for jobs that seem to be just at your level. You will get interviews for some of those jobs. See how each job stacks up. Try for some jobs that seem like a stretch. That's how you grow -- by taking risks. Don't rule yourself out. Trust the process. Good luck in your job search!<br>

            <h3>Types of Questions</h3>
            <p style="color: goldenrod;">Interviewers use five different types of questions - directive, non-directive, hypothetical, behavior descriptive, and stress. Being aware of the different types can help you in the preparation stage as you  build your skills  inventory. It may also help you focus in on exactly what is being asked and what the employer is looking for in specific questions.

            </p>
            <p><h4>1.Directive Questions</h4><br>

                The interviewer determines the focus of your answer. The information that the interviewer wants is very clear. If you have completed the research on yourself, this type of question should be easy to answer.
                
                <h4>Example:</h4> "What skills do you have that relate to this position?"
                
               "I have very good communication and interpersonal skills that I have refined through several summer and part-time jobs working with the public. In addition, I am fluent in both English and French."
               <br><br>
               <h4>2.Non-Directive Questions </h4>
               You determine the focus of your answer. The interviewer asks a general question and does not ask for specific information. The most common non-directive question is

               "Tell me about yourself."

                When answering the question, keep in mind that the employer is interested in knowing how your background and personality qualify you for the job. In your answer, you should cover four areas: your education, related experience, skills and abilities, and personal attributes. As you talk about these areas, relate them to the job you are seeking. Decide what your response will be before starting to speak, this helps to keep responses concise.
                <br><br>
                <h4>3.Hypothetical or Scenario Questions </h4>
                <p>When asking a hypothetical question, the interviewer describes a situation, which you may encounter in the position and asks how you would react in a similar situation. This is a good way to test problem-solving abilities. When answering this type of question, try applying a simple problem solving model to it – gather information, evaluate the information, priories the information, seek advice, weigh the alternatives, make a decision, communicate the decision, monitor the results and modify if necessary.

                <br><h4>Example:</h4> "Suppose you are working your first day in our laboratory, and a fire at a nearby work station breaks out. What would you do?"
                    
                "Before I start working in any laboratory, I always locate the emergency equipment, such as eye washes, fire blankets and alarms. I would also review the safety protocols. So in this situation, I would be aware of these. As soon as I noticed the fire, I would shut down my experiment and if the fire is significant, I would pull the firm alarm and help to evacuate the lab. In the case of very small flame, I would ask the staff member at the station what I could do to help, Which would vary with the type of substances involved.”
                </p>
                <h4>4.Behavior Descriptive or Behavioral Questions</h4>
                <p>This type of question is becoming increasingly popular in interview situations. It asks what you did in a particular situation rather than what you would do. Situations chosen usually follow the job description fairly closely. Some employers feel that examples of past performance will help them to predict future performance in similar situations. There is no right or wrong answer to this type of question, but keep in mind that you should relate the answer to the position. If you are interviewing for a research position, talk about a research project you completed.<br>

                <h4>Example:</h4> "Give me an example of a work situation in which you were proud of your performance."
                    
                <br>"While working as a sales representative for XYZ Company for the summer, I called on Prospective clients and persuaded them of the ecological and economic benefits of Recycling. I also followed up on clients to ensure that they were satisfied with the service They received. This involved both telephone and in-person contacts. I increased sales 34% over the same period in the previous year."
                </p>
                <h4>5.Stress Questions</h4>
                <p>Some questions will surprise you and possibly make you feel uncomfortable during an interview. 

                    <h4>Example:</h4>"  Which do you prefer, fruits or vegetables?" There are many reasons why an interviewer might ask such questions. They may want to see how you react in difficult situations, or they may simply be trying to test your sense of humor. Such questions may directly challenge an opinion that you have just stated or say something negative about you or a reference. Sometimes they ask seemingly irrelevant questions such as,
                    
                    "If you were an animal, what type of animal would you be?"
                    
                    The best way to deal with this type of question is to recognize what is happening. The interviewer is trying to elicit a reaction from you. Stay calm, and do not become defensive. If humour comes naturally to you, you might try using it in your response, but it is important to respond to the question. What you say is not nearly as important as maintaining your composure.
